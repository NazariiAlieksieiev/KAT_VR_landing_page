## Project Title: KAT VR Landing Page

KAT VR is a comprehensive VR locomotion system that offers complete physical control over lower-body actions, enabling you to freely walk, run, and perform various movements in virtual reality.

# Technologies Used

The landing page was developed using the following technologies:

- HTML: The structure and layout of the page were built using HTML to provide a solid foundation for the content.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were used to enhance the visual appeal and create an attractive design.
- Responsive Design: The landing page is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across various devices and screen sizes.
- BEM: BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for organizing and naming CSS classes. By adopting BEM, the project ensures consistency and clarity in the styling implementation.
